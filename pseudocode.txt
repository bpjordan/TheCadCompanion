Cube(Arduino Nano) -> theCube.ino
	- reads gyro data
	- transmits through serial output to transceiver

Base Station (Arduino Uno) -> baseStation.ino
	- On new position data from cube
		- keep tally of position changes from old position
		- update old position to be current position
	- When position data recieved from Solidworks
		- apply net changes to position data and return to solidworks
		- reset net change matrix

Solidworks Addin
	- On solidworks init
		- Prompts user for COM port to use
		- Prompts user for update rate
	- Serial poll (execute based on update rate)
		- send current position data as serial string
		- wait for reply of new translation matrix
		- do C# trickery to make solidworks do the translation
