Cube(Arduino Nano) -> theCube.ino
	- reads gyro data
	- transmits through serial output to transceiver

Base Station (Arduino Uno) -> baseStation.ino
	- reads serial input from transceiver
	- parses into rotation data
	- mutates into solidworks translation matrix
	- mutates matrix into array
	- outputs array to USB

Solidworks Addin
	- On solidworks init
		- Prompts user for COM port to use
	- on new serial line
		- parses serial line into translation matrix
		- does C# trickery to make solidworks do the translation
